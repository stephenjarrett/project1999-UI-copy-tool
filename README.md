# project1999-UI-copy-tool
Simple python app created using chatGPT for educational purposes. It is likely poorly optimized and hard to read but chatGPT did the best it could! I tweaked the code slightly for some minor changes to the UI layout and some field labels.

Project 1999 players can set their game directory, select a character's UI file they want to copy and select a destination character they want to copy their UI/macro/friends list over to.
